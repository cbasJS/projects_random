Applying Styles
    - Inline Styles
        * Inline styles can be applied right on the elements where you 
            want the syles applied.
        * This method is discouraged, because it makes maintenance of 
            code a nightmare.
    - Internal styles
        * Internal styles are applied within the html document in the head section
        * This method should also be used sparingly, because it also makes the styles
            hard to maintain across multiple pages to keep your site consistent.
    - External styles
        * It is best practice to keep your styles in an external stylesheet that can be
            referenced from al the pages of your site. This will keep your code in one place,
            and allows you to reuse your CSS, so you don't have duplicate code all over your
            pages.
